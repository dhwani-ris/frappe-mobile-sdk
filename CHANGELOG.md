## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Initial stable release of **Frappe Mobile SDK** for Flutter (`frappe_mobile_sdk`).
- **Frappe API client** — authentication (password, OAuth, API key, mobile OTP), CRUD, file upload, custom methods, and query-style access via `FrappeClient`.
- **Stateless mobile auth** — `mobile_auth.login` integration with token persistence, session restore, and automatic token refresh.
- **Dynamic forms** — metadata-driven rendering from Frappe DocTypes (`FrappeFormBuilder`, list and document screens).
- **Offline-first data layer** — SQLite storage, offline repository, and bi-directional sync with conflict handling.
- **App guard** — `FrappeAppGuard` for server-driven app status, versioning, and force-update flows (requires [Frappe Mobile Control](https://github.com/dhwani-ris/frappe_mobile_control) on the server).
- **Translations** — load dictionaries from the server and apply to labels in forms and lists.
- **Workflows** — workflow state and transitions on forms when configured on the DocType.
- Example app under `example/` and in-repo docs under `docs/`.
